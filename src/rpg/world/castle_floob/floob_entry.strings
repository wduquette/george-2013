Good grief!  It looks like some kind of mechanical peasant!  I wonder
how it works...

The robotic servants' eyes glow.  "The Princess must not be disturbed,"
they say.  The glow fades.

%string guard.gotquest
The robotic servants' eyes glow.  "The Princess must not be disturbed,"
they say.  The glow fades.

"Wait a minute," you say.  "I'm here to help the Princess.  Hogworth
told me she needed help!"

The servants' eyes glow again, and slowly they move out of your way.

%string guard.retreated
The robotic servant's eyes glow brightly.  "The Princess must be helped.
Help her or die!"

# The Princess

%string princess.name
Princess Floribunda
%end

%string princess.description
Princess Floribunda, daughter of Lord Floob.  Why she's a princess while
he's only a lord is anybody's guess.  But she's got the gown and the 
tiara and the attitude, so why quibble?

%string princess.noquest1
The princess appears lost in thought, staring at a muddy iron grating
in the ground at her feet.  Without looking up, she says, "Go away, please."

"I beg your pardon, your Highness," you say, "But Hogworth said you were in
some kind of trouble.  I'm an adventurer, and I'd like to help."

%string princess.noquest2
The Princess takes a good look at you.  "I'm sorry," she says, "But did you
just say you're an adventurer?  You look like a peasant.  A naive but
possibly promising young peasant, I'll grant you, but still, a peasant."

"I was a peasant," you say.  "Raiders killed my parents and burned my farm,
so I'm out seeking my fortune."
%end

%string princess.noquest3
She looks back at the grating.  "Actually, I could use some help."  She
glances at the forbiddingly dark archway that leads further into the castle.
"One of my father's guests did something foolish, and now the palace is 
filled with the worst kind of creatures.  It's too aggravating, and you can
see I'm having to camp out here in the entry court."  She waves at the bed
in the corner.  "If I had my magic ring, I could clean up up the mess."

"You want me to find your magic ring, your Highness?" you ask brightly.
%end

%string princess.noquest4
"Yes," she says.  "I dropped it, you see, and it fell down through this
grating."

"And that leads to..." you begin.

"The palace sewers, I'm afraid."
%end

%string princess.noquest5
Sewers.  More dirty, stinking, filthy, rat-infested sewers.  Just what you
needed.  You take a deep breath, out here where the air is clear.

"Very good, your Highness.  So how do I get into the sewers?"

"Well, that's the problem," she says, still staring at the grating.  
"I'm afraid you're going to have to go through the palace."

She turns to look at you.

"Good luck," she says.  "You'll need it."

%string princess.gotquest
"I think the maintenance entry to the sewers is in the northeast tower.
Be careful!"
