Kilroy was here.

The treasure isn't.

Life's like that sometimes.

# Notices

%string notice.noises
There's an odd smell in the air, and rustling--lots 
of rustling.  You resolve to move carefully.
%end 

%string notice.ruin
There's a house ahead...or what remains of one.
Apparently these bugs are nasty.  Better leave them
alone!
%end

%string notice.valley
From here you can begin to see more of the valley,
and you can see why they called it Paradise.  Sunshine,
water, fertile soil...it must really have been 
paradise before all this lousy bugs came in.
