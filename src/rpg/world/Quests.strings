# Quest: Sir Fred

%string sir_fred.title
Recruiting Sir Fred
%end

%string sir_fred.description
Sir Fred wants to go questing, but he can't unless he joins up with a
naive but promising young man of low birth such as yourself.  He's a bit
of a snob, but he'd probably be useful.  If Magister Mayhem will grant
you a quest, you'd best go back and try to recruit him.
%end

%string sir_fred.completion
Sir Fred has joined you, a naive but promising young man of low birth,
to aid you in your quests.  It's time to start working on the high destiny
part of the deal.

# Quest: Bug Valley

%string bug_valley.title
Treasure of the Bug Valley
%end

%string bug_valley.description
Gottleib the Thief told you of a valley northeast of 
Floobham. He thinks that there may be a fabulous treasure there, but 
the place was ravaged by huge bugs some years back, and he can't stand 
them.  Perhaps it's worth taking a look.
%end

%string bug_valley.completion
You explored Paradise Valley, and found the chest with the stapler and
the gold.  There's no flies on you!

# Quest: Tasty Egg Maguffin

%string maguffin.title
Tasty Egg Maguffin
%end

%string maguffin.description
Magister Mayhem has asked you to retrieve the Tasty Egg Maguffin
from the Floobham sewers so that he can have breakfast.  Well,
there's no accounting for taste, is there?

Better do it; he won't help you with anything else until you
have.
%end

%string maguffin.completion
Magister Mayhem looked pleased to get the Egg Maguffin you
found in the Floobham Sewers.  I guess there's no accounting
for taste.

# Quest: The Unhappy Princess

%string unhappy_princess.title
The Unhappy Princess
%end

%string unhappy_princess.description
According to Hogworth, down at the Floobham Arms, Lord Floob's daughter
has been looking out of sorts recently.  Undoubtedly there's a service
you could do her, and with any luck it won't involve sewers.
%end

%string unhappy_princess.completion
So know you know why the Princess is unhappy.  I wonder how hard it is
to clean sewage off of a magic ring?
%end

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Quest: The Magic Ring

%string magic_ring.title
The Magic Ring
%end

%string magic_ring.description
So, somewhere in the sewers below Lord Floob's palace is a magic ring
belonging to Princess Floribunda.  All that stands between you and the
ring is a palace full of unsavory monsters, the fruit of some mistake
made by one of Lord Floob's guests.

The northeast tower, she said.  Maybe, she said.  What fun.

%string magic_ring.completion
TBD: can't complete the quest yet.
