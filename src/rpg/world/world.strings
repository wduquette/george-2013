# Signs are plain text, centered for displayed.

%string sign.map
The signs shows a detailed map of the world, with an
arrow labeled "You are Here".  Unfortunately, you can't
read the language the map legend is written in, so the
information is of no use to you.

You might find it more useful to click the map icon down
on the control bar.
