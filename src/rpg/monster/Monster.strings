A hellaciously big rat.  Mess with it at your peril; those fangs look sharp,
and there are bloodstains on its claws.

dungeon fodder.

I wonder what kind of defenses it has?

%string icky_white_thing.description

and it wants to grow on you.
%end

%string lady_bug.description
Wow, that's the biggest lady bug you've ever seen.  Slow moving, docile,
and in the way, but mostly harmless if you leave it alone.

%string manly_bug.description
The Lady Bug's other half, Manly Bugs are big, buff, tough, and 
resourceful.  Watch out!  They spit!  Better not anger them.

orc, but it might as well be.
