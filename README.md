# George 2013

This is the Swing version of my game George's Saga, written as a Java 
learning exercise in 2013.  I was using Java 1.6/1.7 and some version of
Eclipse that I no longer have.  I relied on Eclipse for builds; there's no
external build system.  I haven't tried running it in ages, since that would
take defining a new build system, and hence updating the project tree.  I've
put it here for reference.

See the 2021/2022 version of George's sage, written as a Java 17 learning
exercise, at https://github.com/wduquette/george.
