=== Num:547  Lev:100  Rar:1  Spd:+30  Hp:20000  Ac:150  Exp:60000
He is the Master of the Pits of Angband.  His figure is like a black
mountain crowned with lightning.  He rages with everlasting anger, his
body scarred by Fingolfin's eight mighty wounds.  He can never rest from
his pain, but seeks forever to dominate all that is light and good in the
world.  He is the origin of man's fear of darkness and created many foul
creatures with his evil powers.  Orcs, Dragons, and Trolls are his most
foul corruptions, causing much pain and suffering in the world to please
him.  His disgusting visage, twisted with evil, is crowned with iron, the
two remaining Silmarils forever burning him.  Grond, the mighty Hammer of
the Underworld, cries defiance as he strides towards you to crush you to a
pulp!
